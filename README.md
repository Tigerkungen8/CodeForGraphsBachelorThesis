# CodeForGraphsBachelorThesis

So this is for creating a GUI which can be used to create and view graphs, and also find the graphs MINIMAL treedecomposition (hopefully) given their treewidth, and display it. 

It is mostly for familiarizing myself with Tkinter and NetworkX, maybe helpful for the internship, and also fun.
